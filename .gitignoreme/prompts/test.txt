The current test suite is only a symbolic one. 

We are going to create unit tests for the vlip too. 

For each command we'll create a dedicated spec file. 
Write the tests, and either tests or code are working move on to the next.

Note that we have a utils that will mock the file system, and is tested. see spec/README.txt

Tests should never alter the file ssytem or go outside the fixture. if you find
things you need to cover that the fixture / mocks don't already offer, explain
it and we'll decide how to handle it

For each command: 
        - Write the tests in a dedicated spec file
          - Make sure that tests are menaningful, use the fixtue and pass
            -  Run the full suite to be sure nothing has broken
        When it's all done and passing, add a checkpoint and commit the work,
        then go to the next command
